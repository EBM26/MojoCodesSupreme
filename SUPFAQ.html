			<p class="answer-p">
 		  	There are 3 levels of inserts provided with each pair Superthotics that correct for
              different levels of pronation in your feet. To determine which is best for you, try out each
              of the levels and see which feels the most comfortable initially. If unsure, start
              with the lowest level (Low) and then move to Level 2 (Medium) and Level 3 (High) to see
              how they feel. Always wear the level that feels the most comfortable. Never use the orthotic without a Biodynamic Balance Insert installed and never use with 2 different levels of inserts installed (i.e. one level in the one foot, and a different level in the other foot), unless otherwise instructed by your podiatrist.

		<div class="answer-div">
			<p class="answer-p">
 		    You simply pick the gender (men's or women's) and size of whatever shoe size you normally wear. If you are between sizes, we recommend sizing up to the next size range. Please send us a message, if you have any questions about your specific sizing needs.

			<div class="clear"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="answer-div">
			<p class="answer-p">
 		    Superthotics works with most shoe types where the orthotic can be enclosed, including certain heeled shoes. However, Superthotics will not work well in open sandals, high-heeled stilettos, or any other open shoe similar to those, where they cannot be secured in place.

 		    <p class="question-p">Will Superthotics work for flat feet?</p>
			<div class="clear"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="answer-div">
			<p class="answer-p">
            Yes. If you have flat feet, you need proper arch support, which is one of Superthotics' main features. In addition to using our customizable Biodynamic Balance Inserts to keep your arches from collapsing in, Superthoticsâ€™ durable arch also provides excellent structure and support.

			<div class="clear"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="answer-div">
			<p class="answer-p">
 		    While everyone's frequency of usage may be different, Superthotics isn't like those flimsy drugstore inserts. Superthotics is precision-molded with the same type of high-tech polymers as costly prescription orthotics, so it is designed to last for many years of support and comfort.

			<div class="clear"></div>

		<div class="answer-div">
			<p class="answer-p">
 	        You bet. You just insert the height you want for your Biodynamic Balance Inserts, slip your Superthotics into your shoes and start walking. It's that easy.
            <br>
            Take it from Danielle, she's a bartender who is on her feet for a good 8-10 hours per day and experienced pain starting from her feet and radiating all the way up to her back. Since she started using Superthotics, she said, "Feet pain? Gone. Arch pain? Gone. My ankle feels so much better--my back has never felt so good. And they're super easy! They slip into your shoes, they're adjustable per what your arch type is, and honestly, I am so grateful for them, and I would absolutely recommend them to anyone."

			<div class="clear"></div>
		</div>
		<div class="answer-div">
			<p class="answer-p">
 	        Absolutely! Each pair of Superthotics comes with its own set of low, medium and high Biodynamic Balance Inserts for each foot. That means you will get a set of low, medium and high inserts for your right foot and a set for your left foot.

 		    We only make sizes for adults at this time. As parents know, the feet of children and juniors grow extremely quickly! Superthotics is recommended for adults whose feet have stopped growing.
