IV. Your Choices and Rights<br><br>
A.  Target Advertising<br><br>
We use your personal information to tailor our marketing and advertising efforts. To do this, we provide or make your information available to third party advertising networks (such as Google Doubleclick) and social media companies (such as Facebook). When we provide data to agencies, ad networks, and other parties for targeted advertising, we do not provide them with your name, financial information, or any sensitive information (such as an government ID or date of birth, if we have collected that). <br>
We use online identifiers such as email, cookie addresses, and device identifiers to help us provide targeted advertising to you and others like you. We may also use aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. We may make use of the personal information we have collected from you to enable us to display advertisements to target audiences.<br>
To opt out of targeted advertising, you may use the following links provided by third parties that manage opt outs for some ad networks:
&#9679; http://preferences-mgr.truste.com<br>
&#9679; http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp <br>
&#9679; http://www.aboutads.info/<br>
&#9679; https://policies.google.com/privacy/partners<br><br>

B.  Marketing Communications<br><br>
We may occasionally send you newsletters and emails regarding special offers, promotions, features, or product updates. We may also communicate with you on behalf of third parties about special offers, promotions, features, or product updates we think may be of interest to you, or you may have opted-in to receive newsletters or special promotions from one of our trusted third party providers. 
If you decide you do not wish to receive these communications, you may opt-out by clicking the unsubscribe link or by following the unsubscribe instructions included in the communication.<br>
Note however, that by using the Services, you may not opt-out of some administrative and transactional communications that are reasonably necessary to operate and perform the Services, such as billing or service notifications. You may also opt-out of certain targeted advertising by visiting http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices.<br>
C.  Notice to California Customers - Your California Privacy Rights<br><br>
This section applies to you if you are a resident of the state of California. California Law requires us to disclose certain information regarding the categories of personal information we collect and the rights of California residents in regard to the personal information collected.<br>
For purposes of this section, "personal information" has the meaning provided by the California Consumer Privacy Act (the "CCPA") and does not include information that is publicly available, that is deidentified or aggregated such that it is not capable of being associated with us, or that is excluded from the CCPA’s scope, such as personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Gramm Leach Bliley Financial Modernization Act, or the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994. This section does not apply to information relating to our employees, contractors, applicants, and other personnel.<br>
If you are a California resident, you may be able to request to exercise the following rights, upon verification of your identity:<br><br>
&#9679; The Right to Know, upon verification of your identity, any of the following information related to your personal information we have collected and disclosed in the last 12 months:<br>
&#9679; The specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you;<br>
&#9679; The categories of personal information we have collected about you;<br>
&#9679; The categories of sources of the personal information;<br>
&#9679; The categories of personal information that we have disclosed to third parties for a business purpose, and the categories of recipients to whom this information was disclosed;<br>
&#9679; The categories of personal information we have sold and the categories of third parties to whom the information was sold; and
&#9679; The business or commercial purposes for collecting or selling the personal information.<br>
&#9679; The Right to Request Deletion of personal information we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive a request, we will delete the personal information (to the extent required by law) we hold about you as of the date of your request, from our records and direct any service providers to do the same. In some cases, deletion may be accomplished through de-identification of the information. If you choose to delete your personal information, you may not be able to use certain Website functions that require your personal information to operate. Deleting your personal information will not cancel subscriptions you have purchased.<br>
&#9679; The Right to Opt-Out of Personal Information Sales to third parties. The Company does not sell your personal information for money.
However, sometimes we share your data with Company affiliates and third-party advertising networks. These transfers, which are used to provide you with certain Services and to provide you with personalized Services (including advertising), can be deemed a sale under the CCPA.
Please note that your decision to opt out of the sale of your personal information may impact the availability and quality of some of the Services provided to you.<br>
To exercise your California Consumer Rights, please submit a request by:<br><br>
&#9679; Emailing legaldepartment@idealliving.com with the subject line "California Rights Request," or<br>
&#9679; Completing and submitting our California Consumer Rights Request Form available at under the "DO NOT SELL MY INFO" link at the bottom of the home page.<br>
V.  Miscellaneous<br><br>

A.  Age Restrictions. This Site is not designed for children. We restrict the use of our Services to individuals 18 years old and above. If you become aware that personal data about a person under 18 has been provided to us, please immediately contact us.<br> 

B.  Links. While you are using our Services, you may be linked or directed to other third-party sites outside that are beyond our control. Each of these third-party sites may have a privacy policy different from ours. Please review the privacy policies of these sites. We are not responsible for any actions or policies of such third parties.<br>

C.  Changes to the Privacy Policy. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove any portion of this Policy, in whole or in part, at any time without prior notice. When we do, we will give you notice of the revised Policy by posting the revised Policy on this site and by revising the "Last Updated" date at the top of this Policy. Please check this page periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Services after any changes or revisions to this Policy shall indicate your agreement with the terms of such revised Policy.<br>

D.  Security. The security of your personal information is important to us. When you provide sensitive information (such as a credit card number), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it. However, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure. Therefore, while we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of such information. If you have any questions about security while using our Services, please contact us.<br>

E.  Internal Users:  Collection, Storage, Processing and Transfer of Information. We operate the Services primarily from the United States, which is where your information will likely be collected, stored, and processed. Your information may be disclosed in response to inquiries or requests from government authorities or to respond to legal process in the countries in which we operate and/or store your information. By providing your information or using the Website or Services, you unambiguously understand, acknowledge and agree to our collection, storage, processing and transfer of such information as described in this Policy. <br>
