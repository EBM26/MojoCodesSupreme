            <p>Why are air changes per hour (ACH) important when shopping for an air purifier?</p>

            <p>If you’re not moving the air, you’re not cleaning the air. Experts recommend at least 4 air changes per hour for optimal removal of airborne particles from the air. You can rest assured that AirDoctor purifiers are powerful enough to clean the air 4 times per hour, or every 15 minutes, for their respective room size coverage to deliver you pure, protected air. Many air purifiers base their room size coverage on only 1-2 air changes per hour (ACH). It is important to check that an air purifier has a high enough CADR to circulate the air in the room at least four times per hour.  </p>

            <p>CADR stands for Clean Air Delivery Rate. CADR helps tell you how much of a particular contaminant is removed from the air within a specific period of time, and it creates an objective rating that allows consumers to compare one air purifier to another based on standardized testing. There are 3 pollutants that CADR measures, which are representative of different size particles, and they are: POLLEN, which represents larger particles (20 microns); DUST, which represents medium sized particles (5 microns); and SMOKE, which represents some of the smallest particles (0.1-1 microns). Since CADR represents the filtered airflow, this can be translated to understand square footage for a room size to be cleaned as well as necessary air changes per hour. The higher the CADR numbers, the better the overall ability of the unit to clean your indoor air and the faster the air in the room will be cleaned. You want to be most concerned with the smoke CADR number since that rating represents the removal of the smallest and most dangerous particles.</p>

            <p>AirDoctor’s UltraHEPA air purification technology was independently tested and shown to remove 99.97% of live airborne SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) from the air. These successful results were achieved using the live aerosolized SARS-CoV-2 virus on the AirDoctor 3000 purifier in a test chamber and conducted by U.S.-based MRIGlobal, an independent, not-for-profit contract research organization.<br>
            These results built on AirDoctor's previous independent laboratory testing that showed AirDoctor purifiers remove a variety of bacteria and viruses, including H1N1 influenza, and airborne particles as small as 0.003 microns.<br>
            AirDoctor is not proven to kill or prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). AirDoctor recommends using PPE & following directions of the CDC & other government authorities.</p>
