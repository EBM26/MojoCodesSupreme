					<h3 class="slideH3">Active Lifestyles</h3>
					<p class="slideP">Kids, teens, and adults alike are all involved in sports and physical activities that may be hard on the joints and muscles causing aches and pains. Most times, the problem starts in the foot and overuse or excessive force might cause the foot to pronate of shift out of alignment. This then causes the entire body to fall out of alignment and causes foot, ankle, knee, elbow, hip and shoulder pain, to name just a few. It can even cause you to have to stop being active if the pain becomes too severe. Walkfit Platinum Orthotics are ideal for people like you who have added stress and pain on your feet, and worth giving a try since millions of customers have been getting relief and going back to their favorite activities. </p>
