                <p>We also collect, use, and share Aggregated Data for any purpose. Examples include aggregated statistical or demographic data or data provided in hashed, non-human readable form.

                    <p>We use your personal information to tailor our marketing and advertising efforts. To do this, we provide or make your information available to third party advertising networks (such as Google Doubleclick) and social media companies (such as Facebook). When we provide data to agencies, ad networks, and other parties for targeted advertising, we do not provide them with your name, financial information, or any sensitive information (such as an government ID or date of birth, if we have collected that).</p>
                    <p>We use online identifiers such as email, cookie addresses, and device identifiers to help us provide targeted advertising to you and others like you. We may also use aggregate information to help advertisers reach the kind of audience they want to target. We may make use of the personal information we have collected from you to enable us to display advertisements to target audiences.</p>
                    <p>To opt out of targeted advertising, you may use the following links provided by third parties that manage opt outs for some ad networks:</p>

                            <li><u>Security.</u> The security of your personal information is important to us. When you provide sensitive information (such as a credit card number), we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.

By providing your information or using the Website or Services, you unambiguously understand, acknowledge and agree to our collection, storage, processing and transfer of such information as described in this Policy.</li>

                        <p>Certain jurisdictions have specific legal requirements and grant privacy rights with respect to personal information, and we will comply with restrictions and any requests you submit as required by applicable law. For example, you may have the right to: (1) request to know what personal information has been collected about you and to access that information; (2) correct inaccuracies in your personal information; (3) request deletion of your personal information, subject to exceptions; or (4) request a copy of your personal information.

                        To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the information. When you make a request, we may require that you provide information and follow procedures so that we can verify your identity (and the applicable jurisdiction). The verification steps we take may differ depending on your jurisdiction and the request. Where possible, we will attempt to match the information that you provide in your request to information we already have on file to verify your identity. If we are able to verify your request, we will process it. If we cannot verify your request, we may ask you for additional information to help us do so.<br><br>
                        We will respond to your request within the time period required by applicable law. However, we may not always be able or required to comply with your request, in whole or in part, and we will notify you in that event.<br><br>

                Under the CCPA, a California resident has the following rights: (1) to request additional information about our data collection, use, disclosure, and sales practices in connection with your personal data; (2) to request the specific personal data collected about you during the previous 12 months; (3) to request the deletion of the personal data we have about you; (4) to request a restriction on certain processing of personal data; and (5) to request correction of inaccurate information. You may not be discriminated against for exercising your California privacy rights. You may submit a request to exercise your rights under the CCPA through one of two means:</p>
                <ol type="1">
                    <li value="1">Submit a request via email to <a href="mailto:privacy@idealliving.com">privacy@idealliving.com</a>, or</li>

                </ol>
                <p>Upon receiving your request, we will confirm receipt of your request by email or if you are registered in our customer portal, we may do so by a message directed to you in the portal. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we may take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the information. In some instances, such as a request to delete personal data, we may first separately confirm that you would like for us to in fact delete your personal data before acting on your request.<br><br>
                We aim to respond to your request as soon as reasonably practicable and consistent with any applicable laws. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. You may authorize another individual or a business registered with the California Secretary of State, called an authorized agent, to make requests on your behalf through these means.  We may have a reason under the law why we do not have to comply with your request, or why we may comply with it in a more limited way than you anticipated. If we do, we will explain that to you in our response.<br><br>
                California residents are also entitled to contact us to request information about whether we have disclosed personal data to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes.

Please be aware that not all information sharing is covered by the California privacy rights requirements and only information on covered sharing will be included in our response. We reserve our right not to respond to requests submitted to addresses other than the addresses specified in this paragraph.<br><br>

                <strong>Effective Date:</strong> March 23, 2023<br><br>
                We use cookies and similar tools across our Sites to improve their performance and security and to enhance your user experience. This Cookie Notice explains how we do that.<br><br>
                <strong><u>What are cookies?</u></strong><br><br>
                Cookies are small text files which a website may put on your computer or mobile device when you first visit a site or page. The cookie will help the website to recognize your device the next time you visit. Cookies may be used to remember your preferences and to help you navigate within a website. Web beacons or similar technology have similar functions. We use the term “cookies” in this Cookie Notice to refer to cookies as well as web beacons, pixels, or similar technologies.<br><br>
                There are many functions cookies serve. For example, they can help us to remember your username and preferences, analyze how well our Sites are performing and allow us to recommend content we believe will be most relevant to you.<br><br>
                Certain cookies contain personal information – for example, if you click to “remember me” when logging in, a cookie will store your username.<br><br>
               <strong><u> What sort of cookies does the Company use?</u></strong><br><br>
                1. ESSENTIAL COOKIES<br><br>
                Some cookies are essential for the operation of our Sites. For example, some cookies allow us to identify registered users and ensure they can access the subscription-only pages, or they may facilitate page navigation or assist with security checks.<br><br>
                2. PERFORMANCE COOKIES<br><br>
                We utilize other cookies to analyze how our visitors use our Sites and to monitor website performance. This allows us to provide a high quality experience by customizing our offering and quickly identifying and fixing any issues that arise. For example, we might use performance cookies to keep track of which pages are most popular, which method of linking between pages is most effective, and to determine why some pages are receiving error messages.<br><br>
                3. FUNCTIONALITY COOKIES<br><br>
                We use functionality cookies to allow us to remember your preferences. For example, cookies save you the trouble of typing in your username every time you access the site, and recall your preferences, such as which sections of the Sites you want to see when you log in.<br><br>
                4. BEHAVIORALLY TARGETED ADVERTISING COOKIES<br><br>
                These cookies are used to highlight articles, other content, or services that we think will be of interest to you based on your use of the Sites. They may also be utilized by third parties, such as when a third party consent feed has been included on the Site so that you can view videos.<br><br>
                <strong><i>Does anyone else use cookies on our Site?</i></strong><br><br>
                We do use or allow certain third parties to serve cookies on our Sites. We may allow third parties to serve cookies to help identify fraudulent or automated traffic on our Sites. We may also use third party cookies to help us with market research, improving website functionality, and enforcing website terms and policies.
