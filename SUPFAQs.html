					<p>Yes. If you have flat feet, you need proper arch support, which is one of Superthotics' main features. In addition to using our customizable Biodynamic Balance Inserts to keep your arches from collapsing in, Superthotics' durable arch also provides excellent structure and support.</p>

					<p>While everyone's frequency of usage may be different, Superthotics isn't like those flimsy drugstore inserts. Superthotics is precision-molded with the same type of high-tech polymers as costly prescription orthotics, so it is designed to last for many years of support and comfort.</p>

					<p>Superthotics works with most shoe types where the orthotic can be enclosed, including certain heeled shoes. However, Superthotics will not work well in open sandals, high-heeled stilettos, or any other open shoe similar to those, where they cannot be secured in place.</p>

					<p>Absolutely! Each pair of Superthotics comes with its own set of low, medium and high Biodynamic Balance Inserts for each foot. That means you will get a set of low, medium and high inserts for your right foot and a set for your left foot.</p>

					<p>There are 3 levels of inserts provided with each pair Superthotics that correct for different levels of pronation in your feet. To determine which is best for you, try out each of the levels and see which feels the most comfortable initially.<br><br>
					If unsure, start with the lowest level (Low) and then move to Level 2 (Medium) and Level 3 (High) to see how they feel.<br><br>
				    Always wear the level that feels the most comfortable. Never use the orthotic without a Biodynamic Balance Insert installed and never use with 2 different levels of inserts installed (i.e. one level in the one foot, and a different level in the other foot), unless otherwise instructed by your podiatrist.</p>
